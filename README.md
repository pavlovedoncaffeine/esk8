###TO DO

Android:
1) Add connect button (in case app disconnects from HC-06)
2) Volume button must control slider for ease of use while skating
3) Use Android accelerometer data to log acceleration and speed. Maybe email those logs automatically on every disconnect to yourself?
4) Implement a electrical braking system with vesc?
5) Coasting setting?
6) Adjust read buffer window on android to only show only line of text and not wrap content
6) Better visuals if possible
7) implement a regen amount system?

Arduino:
1) Make arduino send a stop signal to board if disconnected. If not possible implement a heartbeat system for Arduino to check if it receives data from Android
2) implement a braking system?
3) implement a regen amount system?


Add any other important refinements to be made to apps
